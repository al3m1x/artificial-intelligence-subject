SI1 -> This lab focuses on linear regression, a fundamental supervised learning technique used to predict a continuous outcome based on input features. The task involves implementing both the closed-form solution and batch gradient descent to estimate the relationship between car weight and fuel efficiency (MPG), evaluating model performance using mean squared error (MSE), and applying data standardization to improve training stability.
